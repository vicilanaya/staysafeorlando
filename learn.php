					<p>Human trafficking, one of the most pervasive crimes in the world, is a modern form of human slavery. The victims of human trafficking are exploited through force, fraud, and coercion. In the United States, many individuals become human trtafficking victims after being smuggled into the country. However, most human trafficking victims in the country are U.S. citizens.</p>
					
					<p>There are two forms of human trafficking, sex trafficking and labor trafficking, as defined by U.S. Federal Code &#40;22 U.S.C. &#167; 7102&#40;9&#41;&#41;.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Sex Trafficking&#58; </strong>&#34;a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age&#34;</li><br>
							<li><strong>Labor Trafficking&#58; </strong>&#34;the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery&#34;</li>
						</ul>

					<p>People of any age, nationality, gender, sex, race, socioeconomic status, and education level can fall victims of trafficking. The chance of becoming a victim increases in vulnerable populations. These <a href="https://www.ovcttac.gov/taskforceguide/eguide/1-understanding-human-trafficking/" target="_blank">at-risk individuals include</a> &#34;undocumented workers, runaway and homeless youth, individuals with substance abuse or addiction issues, and low income individuals&#34;</p>
					
					<p>As diverse as the state of Florida is, <a href="https://humantraffickinghotline.org/states" target="_blank">Florida is 3rd</a> in the country in reported cases of human trafficking. This crime is highly profitable and poses a low risk to traffickers. Unlike arms trafficking or drug trafficking, human traffickers can sell a person or their services over and over again through the life of the victim.</p>
					
					<p>Traffickers are as diverse as their victims. Sharing traits with their victims, such as cultural background or sex, helps traffickers understand the vulnerabilities and gain the trust of their victims. This circumstance becomes even more difficult when the trafficker is an acquaintance or family member.</p>
